      Thank you to everyone who joined us on our speed dating journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      All outstanding tickets and credits have been refunded.  
      We’ve made the tough decision to pause UrbanSpark due to ever-rising ad costs and the time required to run events. We may or may not be back.
